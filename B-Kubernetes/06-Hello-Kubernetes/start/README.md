My First Container
==================

We're going to run our first container on Kubernetes.


Step 0: Ensure Kubernetes is running
------------------------------------

1. Run `kubectl cluster-info` and `kubectl version`.  If it errored, return to exercise 0 to ensure you're running a Kubernetes runtime.  If you're using Docker Desktop, ensure you're in Linux mode, and you've enabled Kubernetes.


Step 0: Build the Image
-----------------------

For this exercise, we're going to be using the `hellonode:0.1` image built in exercise 2.

1. Run `docker image list` and ensure `hellonode:0.1` is present in the list.  If not, return to exercise 2 to build this image.


Step 1: Craft a pod.yaml file
-----------------------------

In general we won't craft pods directly.  Rather we'll build pods as part of a deployment.  Let's get familiar with what is a pod so when we build a deployment these concepts make sense.

**Note:** Yaml files are white-space significant.  Indenting is done with **2 spaces**, not 4 spaces, not tabs.

Each Kubernetes object has an `apiVersion`, a `kind`, a `metadata` section, and a `spec` section that holds the details.

1. Create a new file in this `start` directory named `pod.yaml`

2. Write these lines:

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   ```

   This says we're using a `Pod` object, and it's found in Kubernetes's `v1` api space.

3. Write these lines:

   ```
   metadata:
     name: hellonode
   ```

   With this, we've named the pod `hellonode`.

4. Add these lines to the `metadata` section:

   ```
     labels:
       app: hellonode
       version: v0.1
   ```

   We're giving Kubernetes a bit of metadata about the pod — a list of arbitrary name-value pairs.  We could put anything we wanted here — service tags, environment name, your favorite color.

   We'll use these when we discuss service's selectors.

   **Note:** both the name and the value must be strings, so ~~`version: 0.1`~~ is invalid, but `version: '0.1'` is ok.  In this case we use `version: v0.1` to ensure it's a string without needing quotes.

5. The next section is the details about the pod — the container(s) in it:

   ```
   spec:
     containers:
   ```

6. We only have a single container, let's specify the container details:

   ```
     - name: hellonode
   ```

   The first `-` creates a new entry in the containers array and begins the object that describes this container.  We then name the container `hellonode`.

7. Let's add the image Kubernetes should pull from docker hub:

   ```
       image: hellonode:0.1
   ```

   We don't start this line with a dash because it's part of the object definition that defines this pod.  (Yeah, yaml is weird.)

   Good thing we built this image previously.  Kubernetes won't need to pull it because it already exists.

8. Add the port details:

   ```
       ports:
       - containerPort: 3000
   ```

8. For reference, here's our completed container details:

   ```
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: hellonode
       image: hellonode:0.1
       ports:
       - containerPort: 3000
   ```

9. Save the pod.yaml file.


Podman
------

If using Podman, we need to push images from the Podman instance into the Kind cluster.

1. Open Podman Desktop.

2. Choose Images on the left.

3. Locate the `localhost/hellonode 0.1` image.

4. On the far-right, click the 3-dots menu, and choose `push image to kind cluster`.

5. Repeat this process for the `localhost/frontend 0.1` and `localhost/backend 0.1` images.

6. Note that the name isn't "frontend" but rather "localhost/frontend". Open pod.yaml and change `image: hellonode:0.1` to `image: localhost/hellonode:0.1`.


Step 2: Schedule the pod
------------------------

1. Open a command prompt in this directory, and run:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
   ```

   This says "please schedule the thing I've got in the yaml file `pod.yaml`.

2. Run this command:

   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   Do you see your pod?  Is it running?

3. Run this command:

   ```
   kubectl describe pods hellonode
   ```

   This command tells us a lot about the pod.

   If using Podman, you may find a second (sidecar) container in your pod: `podman-pause`.  This is Podman "helping" with infrastructure.  It maintains namespaces and cgroups in the pod, and helps route from the Kind cluster to the outside world.  You can usually safely ignore this extra container.

4. Run this command:

   ```
   kubectl port-forward pods/hellonode 3000:3000
   ```

   This command won't end.  It sets up a proxy so you can browse to the pod.  This is generally not a good idea, but we're experimenting.

5. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).  Do you see the site?

6. Hit `Cntrl` + `C` to break out of the port-forward command.  You can check `kubectl get pods` to see the pod is still running.

7. Run this from the terminal:

   ```
   kubectl delete -f pod.yaml
   ```

   We just scheduled Kubernetes to delete this pod.  It'll terminate the container running in it.

8. If you hurry, you can see the pod terminating:

   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```
